# 2020-peptidomics
This git repository contains the code and data for a research project at Lunds University conducted by Erik Hartman and Karl Wallblom.

# Background
This project uses LC-MS/MS peptidomic data retrieved from dressing and acute wound fluid to investigate any potential differences between acute, non-infected and infected wound fluid. We used a results-based approach and simple algorithms and libraries in Python, as well as other open-source software like Deep-AmPEP30, Peptigram and Proteasix, to analyze our data. The git contains all the code necessary to recreate our project, except for the compatability of the web-based 3rd party algorithms, although we've included the necessary formatting, and the output data we retrieved.
